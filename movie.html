            <h3>Plot:</h3>
            <div class="bio">
                <p>Set during the "early years" of the Imperial Galactic Empire, an Empire ship lands on a planet. Lyra Erso (Valene Kane) runs off to warn her husband, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) and their young daughter Jyn Erso. Lyra calls Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and tells him that they have come. Galen says goodbye to his daughter and tells her that he loves her by calling her "Stardust", as he heads off to face the Empire. Lyra also gives Jyn a necklace, telling her that the force will always be with her and she can trust on it.</p>

                <p>Outside, Galen meets Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn), a high ranking Imperial senator, who tries to get him to come back to work for the Empire. He asks about his family, and Galen lies. When Orson tells his stormtrooper bodyguards to check the surroundings, Lyra appears and they have a standoff. During the standoff, despite his pleas, Lyra attempts to shoot Orson, only hits his arm, and is killed. A stormtrooper toy is then discovered, and Orson tells them to give chase to find Galen's daughter. Jyn runs away and manages to hide under a rock. Later, Saw appears and rescues her.</p>

                <p>The film then flash-forwards several years, to the Ring of Kafrene. There, an older teenage Jyn (Felicity Jones) is being held captive in a cell. Meanwhile, the rebel leaders led by Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly), a senator of the Old Republic Senate-turned-Imperial Senate, discuss the Empire's plan to create a giant weapon capable of destroying entire planets.</p>

                <p>On the planet Jedha, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), a Tie-fighter pilot who was with the Empire but now serves the rebels, arrives and is apprehended by the local forces there.</p>

                    <header>Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee</header>
                    <p>Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense,
                        very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped
                        onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking,
                        but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super
                        tense and exciting and beautiful. I was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages
                        Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again Thursday night! There's never been a better time to be
                        a Star Wars fan!</p>

                    <header>I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.</header>
                    <p>Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this
                        movie managed to achieve what the other one couldn't. I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure
                        was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading female actor
                        wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good
                        old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite well,
                        CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely. Overall I think SW fans will
                        love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.</p>
