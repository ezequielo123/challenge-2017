            <p>Felicity Rose Hadley Jones is an English actress. Jones was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, and grew up in

                while her mother was in advertising. They divorced when she was three, and she was brought up with her brother

                Michael Hadley. After Kings Norton Girls School, Jones attended King Edward VI Handsworth School, to complete
                A Levels and went on to take a gap year (during which she appeared in the BBC series Servants (2003)). She
